 * Implementation of a general inverse position kinematics algorithm to calculate the position transformation from
 * Cartesian to joint space of a general KDL::Tree. This class has been derived from the TreeIkSolverPos_NR_JL class.
 * Additional to enforcing joint position limits, the solver has been extended to enforce joint velocity and
