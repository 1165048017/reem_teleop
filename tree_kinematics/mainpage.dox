The tree_kinematics class offers services for forward and inverse kinematics calculations for tree kinematic structures.
The package also includes an inverse kinematics position solver, which respects joint position, joint velocity and
task space velocity limits. It also applies exponential smoothing, when all end points are considered standing still.

\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
